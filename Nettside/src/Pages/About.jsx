        <h4>Om Oss</h4>
        <p>
          The aim is to cultivate a hub for student entrepreneurs and
          professionals, including those from significant local enterprises, who
          are keen on working within a communal and dynamic setting as opposed
          to isolated home offices. As of today, the tenants are Revisorteam,
          YourCompanion, GreenEnergy and VismaAI who seat in private offices. We
          want to attract students who want to work and become entrepreurs. We
          want to also attract individuals who work in groups - larger companies
          centrally in our cities, who live in the region and/or want to move to
          the region, and in that way take their work home and then be able to
          sit in a co-working building, where they meet other like-minded people
          and not alone in a home office.
